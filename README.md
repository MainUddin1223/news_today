## About my Project

The project is a server-side application built using Node.js and Express.js, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for developing web applications. TypeScript is utilized as the primary programming language, bringing static typing and improved tooling to your codebase, resulting in enhanced maintainability and reduced errors.

To handle authentication and secure communication between the server and clients, the project incorporates the jsonwebtoken library. This library allows you to generate and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWT), which can be used for user authentication and authorization.

For database operations and interaction with MongoDB, you have integrated the mongoose library. Mongoose provides an object modeling layer on top of MongoDB, allowing you to define schemas, perform database queries, and handle data validation.

To facilitate logging and monitoring, you have incorporated the winston library. This powerful logging framework enables you to create customizable loggers, handle log levels, and integrate with various transports (e.g., console, file, database) for storing logs.

For input validation and data schema management, you have utilized the joi library. Joi allows you to define validation rules and constraints for incoming data, ensuring the integrity and correctness of the received information.

To enhance the security of your application, you have integrated the bcrypt library. Bcrypt provides secure password hashing and verification mechanisms, protecting user credentials from unauthorized access.

To enforce code quality and ensure consistent development practices, you have employed the husky library. Husky allows you to configure pre-commit and pre-push hooks, enabling automated code linting, formatting, and testing before committing or pushing code changes.

Overall, my project combines various powerful technologies and libraries to build a secure, scalable, and maintainable server-side application. It leverages TypeScript for type safety, incorporates authentication with jsonwebtoken, interacts with MongoDB using mongoose, enables logging and monitoring through winston, performs data validation with joi, and enforces code quality using husky.
